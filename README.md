- emacs-w3m (available on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/w3m))

## Installation
1. Add `nws-query.el` to a directory included in the list `load-path` or modify this list to include the directory with
   `(add-to-list 'load-path "/PATH/TO/nws-query/")` in your init file,
2. add `(require 'nws-search)` to your init-file,
3. (optional) if you wish to keep a local backlog of your queries, set the variable `nws-local` to the directory you wish to keep your backlog in, e.g. `(setq nws-local "PATH/TO/nws/")`.

## Usage
1. Evaluate the main provided function with `M-x nws-search`, browse the opening dictionary frame with w3m-keybindings, close by pressing `q`,
2. if the online service is not accessible you can search your past queries with `M-x nws-search-local`, provided you have set the variable `nws-local` before,
3. if you want to systematically scrape for offline searching, you can use the shell-script `nws-scrape.sh /PATH/TO/nws/` (make it executable with `chmod +x /PATH/TO/nws-scrape.sh` first) within the directory providing this function,
4. (optional) if you are frequently using one or the other function, consider [creating a keybinding](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Key-Binding-Commands.html).
